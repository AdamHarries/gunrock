News!
=====

Gunrock v0.3 released! Check out the [release notes](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/release_notes.html)!

Introduction
============

Gunrock is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the
GPU. It uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused
on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between
performance and expressiveness by coupling high performance GPU computing
primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model
that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small
code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. For more details, please read
[Why Gunrock](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/why-gunrock.html),
our paper on arXiv:
[Gunrock: A High-Performance Graph Processing Library on the GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05387),

Getting Started with Gunrock
----------------------------
- For Frequently Asked Questions, see the
[FAQ](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/faq.html).

- For information on building Gunrock, see
[Building Gunrock](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/building_gunrock.html)
and refer to
[Operating System Support and Requirements](#OS_Support).

- The "tests" subdirectory included with Gunrock has a comprehensive test
application for most the functionality of Gunrock.

- For the programming model we use in Gunrock, see
[Programming Model](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/programming_model.html).

- To use our stats logging and performance chart generation pipeline, please check
out [Gunrock-to-JSON](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/gunrock_to_json.html).

- We have also provided code samples for how to use
[Gunrock's C interface](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/shared_lib_tests)
and how to
[call Gunrock primitives from Python](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/python),
as well as [annotated code](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/annotated_primitives/annotated_primitives.html)
for two typical graph primitives.

Reporting Problems

<a name="OS_Support"></a>
Operating System Support and Requirements
=========================================

This release (0.3) has only been tested on Linux Mint 15 (64-bit) and Ubuntu
12.04 with CUDA 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 installed. We expect Gunrock to build
and run correctly on other 64-bit and 32-bit Linux distributions, Mac OS,
and Windows.

Requirements
------------

CUDA version 5.5 (or greater) and compute capability 3.0 (or greater) is
required.

Several graph primitives' CPU validation code uses Boost Graph
Library.  We are also using Boost Spirit, filesystem, predef, chrono,
and timer in our utility code.  A boost version > 1.53.0 is required.

CUDA
====

Gunrock is implemented in [CUDA C/C++](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda).  It
requires the CUDA Toolkit. Please see the NVIDIA
[CUDA](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) homepage to download CUDA as
well as the CUDA Programming Guide and CUDA SDK, which includes many CUDA code
examples. Please refer to [NVIDIA CUDA Getting Started Guide for
Linux](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux) for
detailed information.

Road Map
========

 - Framework: In v0.3 we have integrated single-GPU and multi-GPU frameworks
   into a unified framework. We are exploring more operators such as
   Gather-Reduce and matrix operators. Generally we want to find the right set
   of operators that can abstract most graph primitives while delivering high
   performance.

 - Primitives: Our near-term goal is to implement maximal independent set
   and graph matching algorithms, build better support for bipartite
   graph algorithms, and explore community detection algorithms. Our long term
   goals include algorithms on dynamic graphs, priority queue support, graph
   partitioning, and more flexible and scalable multi-GPU algorithms.
