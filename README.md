Gunrock documentation
=====================

Introduction
============

Gunrock is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. For more
details, please read our paper on arxiv:
[Gunrock: A High-Performance Graph Processing Library on the GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05387) and check out the [Publications](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock#publications) section.

Getting Started with Gunrock
----------------------------
For Frequently Asked Questions, see [FAQ](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/0.2/faq.html).

For information on building Gunrock, see [Building Gunrock](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/0.2/building_gunrock.html)
and refer to [Operating System Support and Requirements](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock#operating-system-support-and-requirements).

The "tests" subdirectory included with Gunrock has a comprehensive test
application for all the functionality of Gunrock.

For the programming model we use in Gunrock, see [Programming Model](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/0.2/programming_model.html).

We have also provided a code walkthrough of a [simple example](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/0.2/simple_example.html) and [annotated code](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/annotated_primitives/annotated_primitives.html) for two typical graph primitives.

Reporting Problems
==================

To report Gunrock bugs or request features, please file an issue
directly using [Github](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/issues).

<!-- TODO: Algorithm Input Size Limitations -->

Operating System Support and Requirements
=========================================

This release (0.2) has only been tested on Linux Mint 15 (64-bit) with
CUDA 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5 installed. We expect Gunrock to build and run correctly on
other 64-bit and 32-bit Linux distributions, Mac OS, and Windows.

Requirements
------------

Gunrock has not been tested with any CUDA version < 5.5.

Several graph primitives' CPU validation code uses Boost Graph Library v1.53.0.

CUDA
====

Gunrock is implemented in [CUDA C/C++](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda).  It
requires the CUDA Toolkit. Please see the NVIDIA
[CUDA](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) homepage to download CUDA as
well as the CUDA Programming Guide and CUDA SDK, which includes many CUDA code
examples. Please refer to [NVIDIA CUDA Getting Started Guide for
Linux](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux) for
detailed information.

Road Map
========

 - Framework: The structure of the operator code in Gunrock may change
   significantly during near-term future development. Generally we
   want to find the right set of operators that can abstract most
   graph primitives while delivering high performance.

 - Primitives: Our near-term goal is to implement maximal independent set algorithm and graph matching algorithm, build better support for bipartite graph algorithms, and explore community detection algorithms. The long term goal includes algorithms on dynamic graphs, priority queue support, graph partitioning and multi-GPU algorithms.
